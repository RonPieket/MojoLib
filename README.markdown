What is MojoLib?
----------------
MojoLib is a collection of algorithms that I developed for Insomniac's proprietary world editor. It focuses on organizing data in memory. Its functionality can be roughly divided into three areas:

- **Containers** - Several variations on a hash table: a key-only set, a key-value map, a key-multiple-values map, a bi-directional child-to-parent relation table, and a dual ended growable array.

- **String Ids** - 8-byte objects that behave as immutable strings, for use as computationally efficient and yet human-readable object IDs.

- **Set Expressions** - Set theory applied to create rule-based views of the data held in containers.
